* allow setting default notification position
* listen to client when they request a position to 'point to', maybe have a
  little arrow thingy point off the notification window
* don't overlap notifications when more than one is on the screen
* allow dragging notifications to new location
* set input shape mask on newer gtk versions
* window shadow?  would rather the compositor just do this, need to figure out
  why xfwm4 won't
* make more parts of the notification themable
* config dialog (partially done)
* support desktop_id hint?
