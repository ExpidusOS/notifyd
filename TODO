* listen to client when they request a position to 'point to', maybe have a
  little arrow thingy point off the notification window
* set default positions based off _NET_WORKAREA
* don't overlap notifications when more than one is on the screen
* more default positions -- center, top center, bottom center, left center,
  right center
* window shadow?  would rather the compositor just do this, need to figure out
  why xfwm4 won't -- olivier says shaped windows never get shadows
* make more parts of the notification themable
* find a way to completely ditch the old theme when switching to a new one --
  implemented workaround: kill daemon on theme change
* prelight fill for close button circle?
